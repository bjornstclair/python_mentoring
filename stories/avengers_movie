Movie Review: The Avengers

The Avengers is a(n) _ADJECTIVE_ movie about a team of _NOUN-PLURAL_ who have to save _CITY_ from
_ADJECTIVE_ aliens. The superheroes are named _NOUN_-man, Captain _COUNTRY_, Thor, _ADJECTIVE_ Widow, Hawk-_PART-OF-BODY_ and
the _SUPERLATIVE_ Hulk.

The main villain is a _ADJECTIVE_ god named Loki who uses the powers of the _FUNNY-SOUNDING-WORD_ to teleport to earth. He
 controls the _PART-OF-BODY_ of a prominent astro-_NOUN_ as well as Hawk-_PART-OF-BODY#1_. They manage to steal some
 _ADJECTIVE_ Iridium which allows them to stabilize the _TECHNICAL-TERM_ field and open a portal which lets the _ADJECTIVE_
 aliens into _CITY#1_.

 However his plan is foiled by the _ADJECTIVE_ superheroes who use their _NOUN-PLURAL_ to attack the aliens. _NOUN#1_-man
  destroys the mothership conveniently killing all the aliens in a _TECHNICAL-TERM_ blast.

  All the heroes live in the end and agree to eat some _FLAVOR_ _FOOD_. What a great movie!
