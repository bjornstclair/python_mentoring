My _NUMBER-ORDINAL_ birthday party was the _SUPERLATIVE_ party I've ever _VERB-PAST_!

When the _NOUN-PLURAL_ arrived, I met them at the _NOUN_ and gave them all a(n) _ADJECTIVE_ _NOUN_.

Each _NOUN_ placed their _NOUN_ on the _NOUN_, which quickly became a(n) _ADJECTIVE_ _NOUN_.

We played _NUMBER_ party games before _VERB-PROGRESSIVE_ the cake. My favorite was called the _ADJECTIVE_ _NOUN_.

My mom made me a _FLAVOR_ cake with a frosting made from _FOOD_. It was so _ADJECTIVE_!

After that we opened the _NOUN-PLURAL_, and I _VERB-PAST_ each of the guests in turn.

It was so much fun but by the end of the party I started to feel very _ADJECTIVE_ and my mom said it was time for my friends to go home.

I wished them all a(n) _ADJECTIVE_ day and when they all left I fell asleep and had _ADJECTIVE_ dreams of _NOUN-PLURAL_.
